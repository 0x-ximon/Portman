## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us in a responsible manner. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**. This allows us to proactively address the issue before it becomes public knowledge.

2. **Contact the project maintainers privately**. You can reach us at `your-email@example.com` or through our issue tracker at `https://github.com/your-repo/issues`.

3. **Provide a brief description** of the vulnerability and any relevant details. The more information you can provide, the better we can understand and address the issue.

We will investigate the reported vulnerability promptly and work towards resolving it. We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure.

## Security Policy
